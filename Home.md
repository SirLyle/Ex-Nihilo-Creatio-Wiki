# JSON Recipes

⚠️⚠️IMPORTANT NOTE:⚠️⚠️

To be able to modify the recipes via JSON you need to enable it in the main config first.
 `exnihilocreatio.cfg >> misc >> B:enableJSONLoading=true`

It is recommended to use a JSON editor or online JSON validator to make sure there are no syntax errors in your JSON file, one of those is [JSONlint](https://jsonlint.com/) for example (many others work perfectly fine too).
